# Alpha Decay in Force Simulations

## Overview

The `.alphaDecay(value)` function sets or retrieves the rate at which the alpha (cooling parameter) decays over time in a force-directed simulation.

## How It Works

The alpha decay rate influences how quickly the simulation stabilizes:

- **Higher decay values (closer to 1)** → The simulation stabilizes faster but might get stuck in a local minimum, leading to a suboptimal layout.
- **Lower decay values (closer to 0)** → The simulation takes longer but results in a better layout.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody())
  .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2))
  .alphaDecay(0.05);
```


# alphaTarget in Force Simulations

## Overview

The `.alphaTarget(target)` function in D3.js is used to set or retrieve the target alpha value in a force-directed simulation. It controls the intended stability level of the simulation.


### Effect on Simulation

- A **higher target alpha** keeps the simulation active for longer.
- A **lower target alpha** allows the simulation to stabilize faster.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody())
  .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2))
  .alphaTarget(0.3); // Keeps the simulation running actively
```
# Velocity Decay in Force Simulations

## Overview

The function simulation.velocityDecay(decay) in D3.js is used to control how quickly node velocities slow down over time in a force-directed simulation.

### Effect on Simulation

- **Higher decay (closer to 1)** → Nodes slow down faster, which stabilizes the simulation quickly but may result in a less optimal layout.
- **Lower decay (closer to 0)** → Nodes maintain their momentum longer, allowing for a potentially better convergence but can lead to instability if too low.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const simulation = d3.forceSimulation(nodes)
  .force("charge", d3.forceManyBody())
  .force("center", d3.forceCenter(width / 2, height / 2))
  .velocityDecay(decay); //(default: 0.4).
```
